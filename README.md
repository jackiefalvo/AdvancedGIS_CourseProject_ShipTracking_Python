## ENV859 Final Course Project
## Cristiana Falvo, November 2020
### Ship Traffic Exploration in Cape Cod Bay, MA

### Purpose: 
The purpose of this course project is to explore the shipping patterns in Cape Cod Bay, MA. 
This exploratory analysis will help in contextualizing the acoustic data that will
be used in my master's project. Since shipping is the primary source of underwater noise in Cape Cod Bay,
gaining a better understanding of the shipping traffic patterns in the bay should help gain a better 
understanding of the noise patterns. Understanding these patterns could ultimately help management decisions
related to shipping or conservation of species affected by underwater noise.

### Data Credits:
The original data for this analysis was downloaded from Marine Cadastre's Vessel Traffic Data portal 
[https://marinecadastre.gov/ais/]. Data from UTM Zone 19, January 2014 were used for this analysis.

#### Notes for running scripts -- 
There are two jupyter notebook scripts and two .bat files contained in the Scripts folder. Each of the
files is labeled as either Part1 or Part2 -- note that the Part1 notebook should be run using the Part1
.bat file, same goes for Part2. This is to ensure the correct environments are set for each script.
